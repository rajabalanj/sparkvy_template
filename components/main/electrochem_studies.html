                                            Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) is a fundamental electrochemical
                                            technique used to evaluate the charge storage performance of energy storage
                                            devices like batteries, supercapacitors, and pseudocapacitors.
                                            <span id="gcd-full-text" style="display:none;"> In GCD, a constant current
                                                is applied to the device, and its voltage response is measured over time
                                                during both charging and discharging cycles. This technique allows for
                                                the determination of key parameters such as specific capacity, coulombic
                                                efficiency, and cycle life.</span>
