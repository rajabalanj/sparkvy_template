            <h4 class="subheading">Current-voltage characteristics:</h4>
            <p>The current-voltage (I–V) characteristics of a solar cell describe how the output current varies with the voltage across the cell under illumination. This curve is fundamental for evaluating the performance of photovoltaic devices.</p>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h5 class="subheading">1. Short-Circuit Current (I<sub>SC</sub>):</h5>
            <p>The maximum current when the voltage is zero (terminals shorted). It reflects the light-generated current and is proportional to the light intensity and the active area of the cell.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h5 class="subheading">2. Open-Circuit Voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>):</h5>
            <p>The maximum voltage when the current is zero (no load connected). It represents the maximum possible voltage the cell can produce and is a measure of the recombination losses within the device.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h5 class="subheading">3. Maximum Power Point (P<sub>max</sub>):</h5>
            <p>The point on the curve where the product of current and voltage (I × V) is highest. This defines the optimal operating condition at which the solar cell delivers its maximum power output.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
    <h5 class="subheading">4. Fill Factor (FF):</h5>
    <p>A measure of the "squareness" of the I–V curve, calculated as:</p>

    <p>FF = (I<sub>m</sub> × V<sub>m</sub>) / (I<sub>SC</sub> × V<sub>OC</sub>)</p>

    <p>where I<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>m</sub> are the current and voltage at maximum power. A higher fill factor indicates a more efficient solar cell, as it means the cell can deliver more power closer to its theoretical maximum.</p>
