                <p class="card-text">
                    It is a method of crystallizing substances from high-temperature aqueous solutions at high vapour
                    pressures, typically in sealed vessels called autoclaves.
                    <span id="hydrothermal-full-text" style="display:none;"> It mimics the natural geological
                        processes that occur deep in the Earth’s crust. This technique is particularly useful for
                        growing single crystals and preparing various inorganic compounds, including oxides, zeolites,
                        and sulfides, under controlled conditions. The high pressure allows water to remain liquid at
                        temperatures above its normal boiling point, facilitating the dissolution and recrystallization
                        of materials.</span>

                <p class="card-text">
                    Solvothermal synthesis is a highly adaptable method used to create a wide range of advanced
                    materials, especially at the nanoscale.
                    <span id="solvothermal-full-text" style="display:none;"> It is similar to hydrothermal synthesis,
                        but instead of water, it uses non-aqueous solvents under high temperature and pressure in a
                        sealed vessel (typically an autoclave). This approach allows for greater control over the size,
                        morphology, and crystallinity of the synthesized products, making it ideal for preparing
                        metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), chalcogenides, and nitrides.</span>

                <p class="card-text">
                    Sol-gel synthesis is a versatile and widely used chemical method for producing solid
                    materials—especially metal oxides—starting from small molecular precursors.
                    <span id="solgel-full-text" style="display:none;"> The sol-gel process involves transitioning a
                        system from a liquid “sol” (a colloidal suspension) into a solid “gel” phase. This gel is then
                        dried and heat-treated to form the final material. This method is favored for its ability to
                        produce highly homogeneous materials at low temperatures, with precise control over composition,
                        purity, and microstructure, making it suitable for coatings, ceramics, and catalysts.</span>

                <p class="card-text">
                    Green synthesis is an eco-friendly approach to producing materials—especially nanoparticles—using
                    biological resources like plant extracts, bacteria, fungi, or algae instead of toxic chemicals or
                    high-energy processes.
                    <span id="green-full-text" style="display:none;"> Natural reducing agents (e.g., flavonoids,
                        terpenoids, alkaloids) from plant extracts or microbes convert metal ions into nanoparticles.
                        These same biomolecules often act as stabilizers or capping agents, controlling particle size
                        and preventing aggregation. The process typically occurs at ambient temperature and pressure,
                        making it energy-efficient and sustainable. It offers a biocompatible and non-toxic alternative
                        for applications in medicine, environmental remediation, and catalysis.</span>
